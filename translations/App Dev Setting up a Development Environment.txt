APP DEV: SETTING UP A DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT V1.1

OBJECTIVES:
a)In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:
b)Provision a Google Compute Engine instance.
c)Connect to the instance using SSH.
d)Install software on the instance.
e)Verify the software installation.

1: CREATING A COMPUTE ENGINE VIRTUAL MACHINE INSTANCE
	
	gcloud compute engine-create Vm instances "dev-instance"  --zone "us-central1-a" --region "us-central1" --identity and API access-Access Scope
	 "Allow full access to all Cloud APIs."
	 
	
2: INSTALL SOFTWARE ON THE VM INSTANCE
	- In the SSH session, to update the Debian package list, execute the following command:
		sudo apt-get update
		
	- To install Git, execute the following command:
		sudo apt-get install git
		
	- To download the Node.js setup script, execute the following command:
		curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_6.x | sudo -E bash -
		
	- To install npm and Node.js, execute the following command:
		sudo apt install nodejs
		
	
3. CONFIGURE THE VM TO RUN APPLICATION SOFTWARE
	- To check the version of Node.js, execute the following command:
		node -v
			Result: You should see the Node.js version number 6.
			
	- To clone the class repository, execute the following command:
		git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/training-data-analyst
		
	- To change the working directory, execute the following command:
		cd ~/training-data-analyst/courses/developingapps/nodejs/devenv/
	
	- To run a simple web server, execute the following command:
		sudo node server/app.js
		
	- Return to the Cloud Console VM instances list, and click on the External IP address for the dev-instance.
			Result: You should see a Hello GCP dev! message from Node.js.
			
	- To install the Node.js library for Compute Engine, execute the following command:
		npm install
	
	- To run a simple Node.js application that lists Compute Engine instances, execute the following command:
		node list-gce-instances.js
			Result: Many details about your machine should appear in the terminal window.
