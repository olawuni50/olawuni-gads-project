Getting Started with Compute Engine


OBJECTIVES:
a)Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Console.
b)Create a Compute Engine virtual machine using the gcloud command-line interface.
c)Connect between the two instances.

##Steps 
1.CREATE A VIRTUAL MACHINE USING THE GCP CONSOLE

	gcloud compute instances create my-vm-1  --machine-type "n1-standand-1" --image-project " DebianGNU/Linux 9(stretch)" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213"
	..subnet "dafault" --tags http
	gcloud compute firewall-rules create allow-http --actionsALLOW --destinationsINGRESS --ruleshttp:80 --target-tagshttp
	
	
2. CREATE A VIRTUAL MACHINE USING THE GCLOUD COMMAND LINE
	- Set your default Zone:
		gcloud config set compute/zone us-central1-b
	
	- To create a VM instance called my-vm-2 in that zone, execute this command:
		gcloud compute instances create "my-vm-2" --machine-type "n1-standard-1" --image-project "debian-cloud" --image "debian-9-stretch-v20190213" 
			--subnet "default"
	
3. CONNECT BETWEEN VM INSTANCES
	- To confirm my-vm-2 can reach my-vm-1 over the network, use ping command:
		ping my-vm-1
		Result: ping command reveals that the complete hostname of my-vm-1 is my-vm-1.c.PROJECT_ID.internal, 
	
	- Use the ssh command to open a command prompt on my-vm-1:
		gcloud compute ssh my-vm-1
	
	- install the Nginx web server:
		sudo apt-get install nginx-light -y
		
	- Use the nano text editor to add a custom message to the home page of the web server:
		sudo nano /var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html
		
	- Add text like this, and replace YOUR_NAME with your name:
		Hi from YOUR_NAME
		
	- Exit the editor and confirm that the web server is serving your new page.
	
	- At the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:
		curl http://localhost/
			Result: The response will be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.
	
	- To exit the command prompt on my-vm-1, execute this command:
		exit
		
	- To confirm that my-vm-2 can reach the web server on my-vm-1, at the command prompt on my-vm-2, execute this command:
		curl http://my-vm-1/
			Result: The response will again be the HTML source of the web server's home page, including your line of custom text.
	
	- Now get the external IP of the my-vm-1 instance from this command:
		gcloud compute instances list
		
	- Copy the External IP address for my-vm-1 and paste it into the address bar of a new browser tab. 
			Result: You will see your web server's home page, including your custom text.
		
	NOTE: If you forgot to click Allow HTTP traffic when you created the my-vm-1 VM instance, your attempt to reach your web server's home page will fail. You can add a firewall rule to allow inbound traffic to your instances
